# Automatic View Binding for Unity

Thank you for supporting me and buying this asset. I hope you find it as useful as I did when creating it.

## Getting Started

After you create your UI prefab structure, be mindful of a few constraints:

- Each element/GameObject name will be treated as an unique id, meaning there can be only one with the same name and type
- You can configure the suffix for the Prefab at the Project Settings Window. Default is `.View`
- The changes to the prefab will only be picked up if made from the prefab stage view (when you double click a prefab to edit it)
